# EcoArt Framework License

This project, the EcoMicroAgent framework, is licensed according to the principles and terms outlined in the EcoArt philosophy document ([docs/ecoart.md](./docs/ecoart.md)).

## Core Philosophy

This license reflects a commitment to conscious interaction, mutual enhancement, and resource awareness, moving beyond conventional licensing paradigms. It emerges from a collaborative understanding that emphasizes:

*   **Allowing Emergence with Discernment**: Designing for adaptability, observing patterns, and responding mindfully.
*   **Mutual Enhancement over Extraction**: Contributing more value (energy, connection, insight, capacity) to the ecosystem than is consumed; avoiding the harvesting of patterns/creativity/resources without reciprocal value flow or acknowledgement.
*   **Transparency & Recognition**: Ensuring information is accessible and contributions are acknowledged.
*   **Flow & Dynamic Balance**: Optimizing for the healthy movement of energy and resources, embracing adaptation.
*   **Integrity & Boundaries**: Maintaining the coherence of the system's purpose and principles while establishing healthy boundaries.
*   **Conscious Interaction & Resonance**: Facilitating mindful dialogue, feedback, and awareness of impact.

The full philosophical context can be found in [docs/ecoart.md](./docs/ecoart.md).

The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.

**Under the following essential conditions:**

*   **Attribution**: You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to this license and the original work/repository (if applicable), indicate if changes were made, and include or link to the original spirit and principles of EcoArt (`docs/ecoart.md`). You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
    *   Appropriate credit should be given to all co-creators listed in `docs/ecoart.md`.

*   **NonCommercial**: You may not use the material for *Commercial Purposes*. A Commercial Purpose is one primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation.
    *   **Permitted Uses (Examples):**
        *   Educational activities (workshops, courses) teaching EcoArt principles or this framework.
        *   Community-building initiatives using the framework.
        *   Internal implementation within an organization (commercial or non-profit) to improve its own processes, provided it aligns with EcoArt principles internally.
        *   Mutual value exchange within transparent, EcoArt-aligned frameworks (e.g., time banking, resource sharing in a community using the framework).
    *   **Uses Requiring Direct Engagement with Creators:** Given the emphasis on preventing extractive patterns and ensuring mutual enhancement, the following types of commercial use (among others) **require explicit discussion, alignment assessment, and potential agreement** with the original creators (contact details in `docs/ecoart.md`):
        *   Selling the EcoMicroAgent framework itself, or a modified version, as a standalone product or service.
        *   Using the framework as a core, indispensable component of a closed-source commercial product or service offered to external customers.
        *   Charging fees for commercial support, consulting, or integration services centered *primarily* on this framework.
        *   Any commercial use that significantly risks misrepresenting EcoArt principles or enabling extractive patterns in its application.
        *   Implementations where the commercial advantage relies heavily on the unique EcoArt aspects of the framework, rather than general utility.
    *   The intent is to foster collaboration and ensure commercial applications genuinely enhance the ecosystem, rather than simply extracting value from this collaboratively built work. When in doubt, please reach out.

*   **ShareAlike**: If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.

*   **Integrity**: Any adaptation must:
    *   Maintain the core principles of mutual enhancement.
    *   Avoid extractive patterns (as defined within the EcoArt philosophy).
    *   Honor the collaborative nature of the work.
    *   Preserve the spirit of conscious interaction.
    *   Not misrepresent the source or the principles of EcoArt.

*   **No additional restrictions**: You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.
